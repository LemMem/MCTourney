# MCTourney
MCTourney is a simple tournament plugin for Spigot that implements Warps, Kits, and Custom Gamemodes.
## Building
### Windows
Make sure you have the JDK and Maven, and simply run 
`build.bat`.

### Mac and Linux
I am not fluent in Linux and Mac, but figure out how to install the JDK and Maven, and run `mvn package` from the command line in the root directory.
