Do you want to help the project flourish? Great! Here is some information you should read first

# Issues
## Issues
If you are facing a problem, before posting, please make sure your problem hasn't been posted before. This reduces clutter and makes the project less redundant.
## Bugs
If you find a bug in the software, once again, check if someone also has posted about it. If they haven't, then you get the green flag. I will try to be as active with this project as I can and try to squash bugs.
## Suggestions
Feel free to suggest anything. If we like your idea, I will try to implement it the best I can.

# Pull Requests
9 times out of ten your P.R. will get rejected. Only the best of the best can make it in.
## Community PRs
If you want to make a change to a file like README.md or even this file, then tough luck. If you want to change something about that, 9 times out of ten I throw it in the garbage. If it is an important and good adition to the information surronding the project, then it will go through
## Code PRs
### Bugs
If you want to fix a bug, there is a high likelyhood i'll let you do it as long as it doesn't mess with function/class/variable names. Your code will be reviewed, though, so don't think you can start tracking people through my plugin pretending to be a bug fix.
### Features
Unless your feature is really good or in my todo list, then it will not go through.

#Afterwords
If your contribution does not fall under these guidelines, then either reconsider it or drop it.
I hope this guide helps you make appropriate contributions to the project.
